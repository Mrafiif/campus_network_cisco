Project Overview
Designed and implemented a high-security campus network topology using Cisco Packet Tracer. This project focuses on architecting a robust university infrastructure that combines efficient data routing with advanced cybersecurity measures to defend against common network threats, such as unauthorized reconnaissance and data breaches.

Key Technical Implementations
Advanced Threat Detection (IDS): Configured an Intrusion Detection System specifically tuned to identify and alert on Port Scanning activities, preventing attackers from mapping network vulnerabilities.

Active Defense Mechanism (IPS): Successfully deployed an Intrusion Prevention System to monitor network traffic and automatically block malicious packets or policy violations in real-time.

Complex Topology Architecture: Designed a scalable environment involving multiple routers, multilayer switches, and server farms to ensure seamless campus-wide connectivity.

VLAN Segmentation & Subnetting: Applied precise IP addressing and VLAN tagging to isolate departmental traffic, reducing the blast radius of potential internal threats.

Security Policy Enforcement: Established strict access control protocols through ACLs (Access Control Lists) and secure routing to maintain data integrity across the infrastructure.

Tech Stack & Core Concepts
Tools: Cisco Packet Tracer.

Security Focus: IDS (Intrusion Detection System), IPS (Intrusion Prevention System), Port Scanning Mitigation, and Network Forensics.

Networking: Routing Protocols, VLAN Segmentation, and Firewall Management.
