Project Overview
Developed a comprehensive campus network topology using Cisco Packet Tracer, focusing on high-level security implementation and efficient routing. This project was specifically designed to simulate a secure university environment, ensuring robust data protection and traffic management across multiple departments.

Key Technical Implementations
Intrusion Prevention System (IPS): Successfully configured and deployed IPS to monitor, detect, and automatically block malicious activities or policy violations within the network.

Network Topology Design: Architected a scalable campus-wide network involving routers, switches, and server configurations to ensure seamless connectivity.

VLAN & Subnetting: Implemented efficient IP addressing schemes and VLAN segmentation to isolate departmental traffic and improve network performance.

Security Policy Enforcement: Configured Access Control Lists (ACLs) and other firewall principles to maintain strict control over inbound and outbound traffic.

Tech Stack & Tools
Simulator: Cisco Packet Tracer.

Core Concepts: IPS (Intrusion Prevention System), Routing Protocols, Switching, and Cybersecurity.
